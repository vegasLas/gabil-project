# This is a placeholder for an actual MBTiles file
# In a real deployment, replace this with your actual offline map data
# 
# MBTiles files are SQLite databases containing map tiles
# They follow the MBTiles specification: https://github.com/mapbox/mbtiles-spec
#
# To create MBTiles files, you can use tools like:
# - TileMill (by Mapbox)
# - MOBAC (Mobile Atlas Creator) 
# - QTiles (QGIS plugin)
# - Custom scripts using libraries like TileStache
#
# For testing purposes, you can download sample MBTiles from:
# - OpenMapTiles: https://openmaptiles.org/
# - Natural Earth: https://www.naturalearthdata.com/
# - Or create custom tiles from OpenStreetMap data
#
# File size: MBTiles files can be large (several GB) depending on:
# - Geographic area covered
# - Zoom level range (typically levels 1-18)
# - Map style and detail level
#
# Once you have a real MBTiles file:
# 1. Replace this placeholder file
# 2. Ensure the filename matches what's referenced in CustomMapControl.cs
# 3. Make sure the file is properly included in the project build
